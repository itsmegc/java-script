// In JavaScript (and object-oriented programming in general), the terms "object" and "instance" are related but have distinct meanings. Here's a clear explanation of the difference between the two:

// ### 1. **Object**:
// An **object** in JavaScript is a data structure that allows you to store collections of key-value pairs. It can represent anything with properties and behavior. Every object in JavaScript is a standalone entity with its own properties and methods.

// You can create objects in JavaScript in several ways, including:

// - **Object literal**:

//   const car = {
//     make: "Toyota",
//     model: "Camry",
//     year: 2020
//   };


// - **Using a constructor function or a class**:

  class Car {
    constructor(make, model, year) {
      this.make = make;
      this.model = model;
      this.year = year;
    }
  }
  
  const myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2020); // This creates an instance of Car


// In this example, both `car` and `myCar` are objects because they store data in key-value pairs (e.g., `make`, `model`, and `year`).

// ### 2. **Instance**:
// An **instance** refers specifically to an object that is created using a **class** or **constructor function**. It is a concrete occurrence of any object type, typically created using the `new` keyword.

// For example:
// - In the class example above, `myCar` is an **instance** of the `Car` class.
// - You can think of an instance as a **specific realization** of a general blueprint (the class or constructor function). The instance is an individual object that is created from a class or constructor function, but not every object is an instance (as objects can also be created without classes).

// ### Key Difference:
// - **Object**: A general concept that refers to any entity that has properties and behavior (methods) in JavaScript. An object can be created using object literals, functions, or classes.
// - **Instance**: A specific object that is created using a class or constructor function. Instances follow the structure and behavior defined by the class or constructor.

// ### Example:

// Define a class

class Dog {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    this.name = name;
    this.breed = breed;
  }
}

// Create an instance of Dog
const myDog = new Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever");

console.log(myDog); // Output: Dog { name: 'Buddy', breed: 'Golden Retriever' }


// In this example:
// - `myDog` is an **instance** of the `Dog` class.
// - `myDog` is also an **object** because it has properties and methods.
  
// However, not all objects are instances of a class:

const cat = {
  name: "Whiskers",
  breed: "Tabby"
};
// ```
// - `cat` is an **object**, but itâ€™s **not an instance** of a class because it was created using an object literal, not a constructor or class.

// ### Summary:
// - An **object** is any entity with properties and methods in JavaScript.
// - An **instance** is a specific object created using a class or constructor function.
